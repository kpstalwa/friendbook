# FriendBook: A social networking site

This is social networking site putting together of all that I have learned so far in web development with Rails. 

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

```
$ rails server
```
